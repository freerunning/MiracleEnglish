1
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,000
烧死他们
Burn them all!

2
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,090
我妹妹在哪里
Where's my sister?

3
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,560
烧死他们
Burn them all!

4
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,720
求求你
Please.

5
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,700
烧死他们  
Burn them. Burn them all!

6
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,180
烧死他们
Burn them all!

7
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,620
梅拉
Meera.

8
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,140
他们发现我们了
They found us.

9
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,230
对不起
I'm so sorry.

10
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,440
跟我来  快
Come with me, now.

11
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,970
死人是不会停步的
The dead don't rest.

12
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,770
真绿
It's so green.

13
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,330
是啊
Oh, yes.

14
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,620
一到河间地以南
Once you get south of the Riverlands,

15
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,130
地上的树种类就多起来了
very different sorts of trees start to take over.

16
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,560
枫树  榆树  山毛榉  白杨
Maple, elm, beech, poplar.

17
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,550
柳树
The odd willow.

18
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,820
不过现在夏天已经过去
And of course now that summer's over,

19
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,250
你会看到一些秋天的颜色加进来
you'll start seeing the autumn colors coming in.

20
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:28,960
但是你在这边能见到的绿色仍然比别处都多
Still, you'll find more green here than anywhere else.

21
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,550
你紧张了  你一紧张就不停说话
You're nervous. You're a nervous talker.

22
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,350
一点儿也不比一紧张就说不出话好
That's not any better being a nervous mute.

23
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,390
我还以为再也回不来了
I didn't think I'd ever come back here

24
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,080
当初离开前父亲逼我放弃封号和继承权
after my father made me renounce my title and inheritance

25
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,890
还威胁说不合作就杀掉我
and, well, threaten to kill me if I didn't.

26
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,540
那种时候凭谁也知道这个家不要我了
A person just doesn't feel welcome at that point.

27
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,380
更没想过有天会带妻儿来见他
And I certainly didn't expect to be introducing him to my family.

28
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,490
你知道见了他们怎么说吧
So you know what to tell them.

29
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,410
说小山姆是你的孩子
That Little Sam is your baby.

30
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,290
是的  这非常重要
Yes, now that's very important.

31
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,580
让他认为小山姆是他孙子
If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild,

32
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,790
他就会接纳你们
he'll take you in.

33
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,210
小山姆会有人教  读书识字
He'll get an education. He'll learn to read.

34
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,490
你也能帮忙教他
And you can help teach him. Huh?

35
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,130
你怎么跟家里人讲我的
What did you tell your family about me?

36
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,440
我跟他们说  在北境遇见的你
I told them I met you in the North.

37
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,330
你讲了是多北的北边吗
Did you tell them how far north?

38
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,290
写信的纸没那么大张啦
Well, it wasn't a very large piece of parchment.

39
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,320
你没告诉他们我的真实来历
You didn't tell them where I'm really from?

40
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,040
没告诉他们我是野人
You didn't tell them I'm a wildling?

41
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,190
问题是
The thing is...

42
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,380
我父亲不喜欢野人
my father doesn't like wildlings.

43
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,190
他希望我能成为男子汉
He hoped I'd make a man of myself by 

44
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,120
去"杀几个该死的野人"
"Killing some bloody wildlings,"

45
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,730
所以如果可能的话  最好不要提这事
so it's probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible.

46
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,850
我想我们到了
I think we're here.

47
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,570
山姆
Sam.

48
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,250
山姆
Oh, Sam.

49
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,690
您好  母亲
Oh, hello, Mother.

50
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,090
我还以为再也见不到你了
I never thought I'd see you again.

51
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,820
你气色不错
You look wonderful.

52
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,110
塔拉
Talla?

53
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,780
诸神啊  你长成大姑娘了
Gods, you're a woman now.

54
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,300
父亲要我嫁给西蒙·佛索威
Father says I have to marry Symun Fossoway.

55
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,490
-他一口黄牙...  -够了  塔拉
- He has yellow teeth-- - That's enough, Talla.

56
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,880
母亲  这是吉莉
Oh, um, Mother, this is Gilly.

57
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,340
天哪
Oh, my.

58
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,440
你真漂亮
You are lovely.

59
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,460
很高兴认识您  塔利夫人
I am happy to know you, Lady Tarly.

60
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,030
还有这个
Oh, and this,

61
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,170
是我们的儿子山姆威尔
this is our son Samwell.

62
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,750
你好啊  小家伙
Hello, little one.

63
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,040
我是你的祖母
It's me, your grandmother.

64
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,130
可以抱抱他吗
May I hold him?

65
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,820
当然了
Yes, of course.

66
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,980
一看就是个鬼机灵
You have a curious mind, I can tell.

67
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,660
跟你爸爸一样  长大了要当学士
You'll be a scholar like your father.

68
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,470
父亲去哪儿了  狄肯呢
Where is Father? And Dickon?

69
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,590
他们去打猎了
They're on a hunt.

70
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,950
晚饭时候回来
They'll join us for dinner.

71
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,130
进来吧  这么远的路
Come inside. Such a journey.

72
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,780
一定累坏了
You must be exhausted.

73
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,590
来吧  颠簸一路你一定想洗澡
Come, you'll be wanting a bath after all that travel.

74
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,470
还要换一件正餐穿的裙子
Oh, and a dress for dinner.

75
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,990
你可以穿我的
You can wear one of mine.

76
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,760
你喜欢什么颜色
What's your color?

77
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,780
午夜蓝还是银色
Midnight blue or silver?

78
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,120
或许银色  快来
Silver, maybe. Come.

79
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,690
你愿意话可以在我的房间里选一间住
You can choose one of my bedrooms if you want.

80
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,050
没有别的办法吗
Is there no other way?

81
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,480
你怕她有危险
You're afraid for her?

82
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,120
我当然怕
Of course I'm afraid for her!

83
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,600
看起来就很危险
It just seems very dangerous.

84
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,940
她会受到保护的
She'll be protected the entire way.

85
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,790
战士之子对越界之人
The Faith Militant are very stern

86
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,240
绝不容情
with those who overstep their bounds.

87
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,050
况且玛格丽王后不是你母亲
And Queen Margaery isn't your mother.

88
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,950
我想诸神也会为她
I suspect the gods will predispose the common people

89
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,160
让平民温和起来
to gentleness on her behalf.

90
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,830
她真正对他们敞开过心扉
She's truly opened her heart to them.

91
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,150
她一直都热衷帮助穷苦和不幸的平民
She's always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate.

92
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,930
对七神也诚心信奉
And now she's devoted to the gods as well.

93
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,070
你想见她吗
Would you like to see her?

94
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,570
他们有伤害你吗
Have they hurt you?

95
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,270
他们有对你不好吗
Have they mistreated you?

96
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,120
-没有  陛下  -我好想你
- No, Your Grace. - I've missed you.

97
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,240
你都不知道我多想你
More than you could know.

98
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,380
我们很快就能团聚了
We'll be together again soon

99
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,230
一切都会比从前好
and everything will be better than it was before.

100
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,800
怎么会好
Better how?

101
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,440
很快就有...
Soon the--

102
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,730
赎罪之旅
walk of atonement.

103
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,830
他说没有别的办法
He says there's no other way.

104
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,760
你跟大麻雀谈过吗
Have you spoken to him at all, the High Sparrow?

105
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,650
是的  谈过几次
Yes, a few times.

106
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,000
你呢
Have you?

107
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,170
谈过
Yes, I have.

108
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,790
他跟我们想的不太一样  是吧
He's not quite what we thought he was, is he?

109
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,200
你觉得我疯了
You think I'm mad.

110
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,420
我听上去像是疯了
I sound mad.

111
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,520
不  没有
No. No, you don't.

112
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,610
你绝不会的
You-- you could never.

113
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,350
你说得对  他是跟我们想的不一样
You're right, he's not.

114
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,890
他要更...
He's a lot more--

115
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,240
是的
He is.

116
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,720
他很特别
There's something about him.

117
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,950
他看待这世界的方式
His way of looking at the world.

118
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,970
承认真实的自己并不容易
It's not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are.

119
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,440
我花了好久才肯面对
It's taken me a while.

120
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,400
他帮助了我
He's helped me.

121
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,180
你在说什么呢
What are you talking about?

122
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,510
你是个好人  你一直是个好人
You're a good person. You've always been a good person.

123
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,330
你是我认识的最好的人
You're the best person I know. 

124
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,430
我刚刚还跟他谈起你对穷人的奉献
I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor.

125
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,590
是啊  我去他们的茅舍
Ah, yes, I visited their hovels

126
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:58,130
我给他们汤喝  而且确保让人看到
and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it.

127
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,350
但他们真正需要的我没有给他们
I never gave them what they really needed, though.

128
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,900
我有很多时间去思考我多么擅长假仁假义
I've had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good.

129
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,870
我对自己的本质  行善的动机
All those stories I told myself about who I was

130
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,480
充满了自欺欺人的想法
and why I did the things I did.

131
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,870
其中有太多谎言
There were so many lies in those stories.

132
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,860
我不懂
I don't understand.

133
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,040
没关系  真的
It's all right. It really is.

134
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,940
放下那些谎言让我如释重负
It's such a relief to let go of those lies.

135
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,450
那洛拉斯呢
What about Loras?

136
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,640
我爱我哥哥
I love my brother.

137
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,880
我会永远爱我哥哥
I will always love my brother.

138
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,690
他的灵魂是纯粹而完美的
His soul is pure and perfect.

139
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,230
他的罪孽并不能抹去那份纯洁
His sins don't erase that purity,

140
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,110
只是遮掩了它
they only obscure it.

141
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:56,020
他只需要赎罪
He just needs to atone for them.

142
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,550
我们都得赎罪
We all do.

143
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,510
不论如何  或迟或早
Sooner or later, one way or another.

144
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,980
诸神对我们所有人都有计划
The gods have a plan for us all.

145
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,880
穿这个走路真不舒服
It's hard to walk in this.

146
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:27,990
真美
It's beautiful.

147
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,060
你真美
You're beautiful.

148
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,950
这鹿肉  很好吃
This venison, it's very tasty.

149
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,260
是今天打来的吗
Is it from today's hunt?

150
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,760
不是
Well, no.

151
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,460
那只还没处理完呢
We haven't been able to cure that one yet.

152
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,400
这只是上周的
This is last week's.

153
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,610
当然了  抱歉
Oh, of course. Sorry.

154
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,870
路途劳顿
Long journey.

155
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,000
在七十码开外射倒了它
Brought it down from 70 yards.

156
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,150
一击致命
One shot.

157
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,220
好远啊
Oh, that's a fair distance.

158
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,500
你在长城也常打猎吗
So do you do much hunting up at the Wall?

159
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,590
是的  当然
Oh, yes. Yes.

160
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,920
常打呢
A good amount.

161
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,420
在长城以北
North of the Wall,

162
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,590
不打猎就没得吃
you don't hunt, you don't eat.

163
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,310
一般是猎鹿还是跟我们一样猎麋鹿
Mostly deer or is it elk as well?

164
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,130
兔子
Rabbits.

165
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,230
有时候猎松鼠
Sometimes squirrels.

166
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:14,270
"我们"主要是指我朋友琼恩
I say "We," It's my friend Jon mostly.

167
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,330
有时还有艾迪
Sometimes Edd.

168
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,230
还有吉莉
Oh, and Gilly.

169
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,180
她也是个好猎手
She's-- she's quite a good hunter as well.

170
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,560
女猎手
Um, huntress.

171
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,670
这在你们那里是常事吧
I imagine it's common where you're from.

172
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,190
我们遇到过一个人
We once met a man,

173
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,620
最后壁炉城的安柏大人  对吧  蓝道
Lord Umber from Last Hearth, wasn't it, Randyll,

174
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,010
说他的女儿都要学打猎
who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt.

175
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,120
你父亲教你打猎吗
Your father taught you to hunt?

176
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,790
我们的父亲是绝不会教我们的
Our father would never teach us.

177
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,110
我们的父亲大概能跟你父亲学学
I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father.

178
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,800
够了
That's enough of that.

179
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,940
山姆威尔  你还想再来点面包吗
Samwell, would you care for more bread?

180
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,750
好  当然
Yes. Yes, please.

181
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,890
谢谢  妈妈
Thank you, Mother.

182
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,360
还不够胖吗
Not fat enough already?

183
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,480
我是依总司令的命令南下
I travelled south under orders from the Lord Commander.

184
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,560
-他要我...  -我读过你的信
- He wants me to-- - I read your letter.

185
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,950
你要做个学士
You're to be a maester.

186
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,100
是的  等我拿到了项链
Yes. And once I have my chain,

187
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,560
我就回黑城堡
I'll return to Castle Black.

188
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,570
我以为守夜人能让你历练成男人
I thought the Night's Watch might make a man of you.

189
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,550
至少有点男人样
Something resembling a man at least.

190
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,570
你还是那么软弱  肥胖
You managed to stay soft and fat.

191
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:42,180
埋头读书
Your nose buried in books.

192
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:46,530
终生读着比你强的人的成就
Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men.

193
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,380
我敢说你至今都不会骑马挥剑
I'll wager you still can't sit a horse or wield a sword.

194
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,420
蓝道  做守夜人的学士是无上的荣耀
Randyll, to be maester of the Night's Watch is a great honor.

195
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,240
他会挥剑
He can wield a sword.

196
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,240
他杀了一个瑟恩人
He killed a Thenn.

197
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,850
他杀了一个异鬼
He killed a white walker.

198
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,480
那根本不存在
There's no such thing.

199
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,560
我们南下去黑城堡的路上我亲眼所见
I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black.

200
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,790
他用一把匕首刺中了异鬼的心脏
He drove a dagger into the walker's heart.

201
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:18,340
他不止一次为救我冒生命危险
He risked his own life to save mine more than once.

202
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,480
他是你俩永远比不上的伟大勇士
He's a greater warrior than either of you will ever be.

203
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,300
你们南下去黑城堡的路上
Your way down to Castle Black?

204
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,680
你在哪儿杀的异鬼
Where did he kill a white walker?

205
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,930
你从哪儿来
Where are you from?

206
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,150
你怎么遇见我儿子的
How'd you come to meet my son?

207
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,570
守夜人来了我们的堡垒
The Night's Watch came to our keep.

208
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,300
-在哪里  -吉莉
- Where? - Gilly.

209
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,560
-长城以北  -长城以北
- North of the Wall. - North of the Wall?

210
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,890
你是野人
You're a wildling.

211
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,420
七国对这些野蛮人
The Seven Kingdoms have waged war

212
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,480
宣战数百年
against these savages for centuries

213
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,890
我却在自家大厅里招待了一个
and here I sit hosting one in my hall

214
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,290
多亏了我儿子
thanks to my son.

215
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,350
看见那柄剑了吗
See that sword?

216
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,540
它叫碎心
It's called Heartsbane.

217
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,140
在我们家族传承了五百年
It's been in our family for 500 years.

218
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,540
它是一把瓦雷利亚钢剑
It's Valyrian steel.

219
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,590
世上屈指可数
Only a handful of them left in the world.

220
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,050
本该在我死后  传给我的长子
It's supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die.

221
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,180
传给他
To him.

222
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,730
他永远用不了那剑
He will never wield that sword.

223
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,880
他要是成为角陵伯爵
If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill,

224
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,080
这个家族就完了
it would be the end of this house.

225
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:54,000
我见到你时  以为你是鼹鼠村的婊子
I took you for a Mole's Town whore when I saw you

226
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,800
这我可以接受
and I made my peace with that.

227
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,390
还有谁会跟着他呢
Who else would have him?

228
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,400
但我高估了他
But I overestimated him.

229
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:03,950
不
No.

230
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,470
引诱我儿子的是个野人婊子
It was a wildling whore that seduced my son.

231
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,560
你是在报复我吗  儿子
This you getting back at me, boy?

232
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,840
把她带回家  让我跟她同桌吃饭
Bringing that to my table and making me dine with it?

233
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:25,860
你得到你想要的了  不是吗
And you got what you were after, didn't you?

234
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:30,080
一个野种  一个混血野种
A bastard. A half-breed bastard.

235
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,480
让你成为我们家的一员
Your invitation into our home.

236
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,120
走吧  亲爱的  塔拉
Come, my dear. Talla.

237
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,890
我没胃口了
I've lost my appetite.

238
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,260
他让家族蒙羞
He dishonors us.

239
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,940
你让你自己蒙羞
You dishonor yourself.

240
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:51,360
你母亲是个好人  你配不上她
Your mother's a fine woman. You're not worthy of her.

241
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,040
为了哄她开心  我会接纳野人
To please her, I'll take the wildling in.

242
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,640
她可以在厨房干活
She can work in the kitchens.

243
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:01,320
你的野种交给家里抚养
The bastard will be raised here.

244
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:07,700
但这是你在角陵待的最后一夜
But this will be the last night you ever spend at Horn Hill.

245
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,550
抱歉  我放任他那样对待你
I'm sorry I let him treat you that way.

246
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,570
我担心他不肯接纳你和小山姆
I was afraid he'd turn you and Little Sam away.

247
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,560
我不生你的气
I'm not angry at you.

248
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,440
我生气的是
I'm angry that horrible people

249
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,090
坏人那样对待好人  却不遭报应
can treat good people that way and get away with it.

250
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,180
你什么时候出发
When do you have to go?

251
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,620
天亮就走
First light.

252
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,870
代我跟他道别
Say good-bye to him for me.

253
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,530
你不是他说的那种人  山姆
You're not what he thinks you are, Sam.

254
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,250
他不知道你是什么样的人
He doesn't know what you are.

255
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,550
再见  吉莉
Good-bye, Gilly.

256
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,290
-山姆  -我们走
- Sam? - We're leaving.

257
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,620
-什么  -收拾行李
- What? - Get your things.

258
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,040
我没有行李
I don't have any things.

259
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,890
-你在做什么  -我们应该在一起
- What are you doing? - We belong together.

260
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,630
我们仨
All of us.

261
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,940
你母亲和妹妹怎么办
What about your mother and sister?

262
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,480
她们会理解的
Oh, they'll understand.

263
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,680
你妹妹的裙子
Your sister's dress.

264
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,160
她不会在意的
She won't mind.

265
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,540
反正你穿着也比她好看
Looks better on you anyway.

266
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,030
山姆
Sam.

267
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,930
那是你父亲的剑
That's your father's sword.

268
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,110
是我家族的剑
It's my family's sword.

269
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,320
山姆
Sam.

270
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,010
他不会想要夺回去吗
Won't he come for it?

271
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,250
他大可一试
He can bloody well try.

272
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,270
狮子和玫瑰喜结良缘
The lion and the rose are one.

273
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:50,550
感谢天上诸神
I thank the gods above.

274
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,940
对你  我美丽的新娘
And to you, my beauteous bride,

275
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,480
我许诺永恒的爱
I pledge undying love.

276
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,830
乔佛里国王万岁  玛格丽王后万岁
Hail King Joffrey. Hail Queen Margaery.

277
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:02,250
我要敬我的新王后一杯
I'll drink a toast to my new queen,

278
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,400
没有比她更美的女人
for there is no one fairer.

279
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,880
亲爱的舅舅  你愿意分享我的喜悦
Dear Uncle, will you share my joy

280
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,210
为我斟酒吗
and be my royal cupbearer?

281
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:11,830
多喝一点甜酒
Drink long and deep, my noble king,

282
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,920
我高贵的国王
from this cup of sweet wine.

283
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,860
这会是他喝的最后一杯酒
The last drink he shall ever take.

284
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:19,360
这是我的复仇
And vengeance shall be mine.

285
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,240
有毒
Poison!

286
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,280
谋杀
Murder!

287
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,380
我气喘吁吁  我死期将近
I gasp. I-- I die.

288
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,440
我踉踉跄跄
I limp.

289
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,640
是他
And it was he...

290
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:47,550
毒死了我
that poisoned me.

291
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,360
我恶毒的舅舅小恶魔
My evil Uncle Imp.

292
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,340
我的长子
My firstborn son.

293
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,900
我的黄金狮子
My golden lion

294
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,820
被卑鄙错误地杀死
foully, falsely slain.

295
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,980
愿你能够安息
I pray you found a lasting peace

296
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:16,680
免受冲突和痛苦
free from strife and pain.

297
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,940
听听我的祈祷  残忍的诸神
Hear my prayer, Oh cruel gods.

298
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,800
让我替他去死
Take my life instead.

299
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:26,610
我亲爱的儿子死了  我也活不下去
For I cannot face another day when my sweet boy is dead.

300
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,470
悲伤
Oh, woe.

301
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,740
痛苦
Oh, grief.

302
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:36,880
最黑暗的日子  我的心充满哀痛
Oh, darkest day, my heart is full of sorrow.

303
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,370
希望通通破灭
All hope is lost.

304
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,990
快乐烟消云散
All joy is gone.

305
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,220
明天也不复存在
And there is no tomorrow.

306
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,660
我听到闻到的是什么
What is that I hear and smell?

307
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,540
马上就会被我送入地狱的人
Someone I'll soon send to hell.

308
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,470
是时候见证传言的真假了
It's time to see if truth they told

309
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:23,040
据说泰温·兰尼斯特能拉出黄金
who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.

310
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,130
你这个禽兽  禽兽
You beast. You beast.

311
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:31,940
你害死了我的妻子  现在又杀了自己的父亲
You killed my wife and now you've taken your father's life.

312
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,080
没有比你更大逆不道的儿子了
No worse child ever stained this land.

313
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,220
我诅咒为你命名的那一天
Curse the day I named you.

314
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:50,770
这是我最大的罪孽  现在我得跑了
My greatest crime. Now I must flee.

315
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:53,360
我要穿过狭海
Then sail across the Narrow Sea

316
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,340
背叛你到底
to do unto you more treachery.

317
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:01,820
不要畏惧寒冬  畏惧我吧
Don't fear winter. Fear me!

318
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:07,000
谢谢
Thank you.

319
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:11,000
女士们先生们  让我们感谢比安卡
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Bianca,

320
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,880

323
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,740
最后  我们最出色的
And last but not least,

324
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,910
亲爱的克连恩夫人
sweet Lady Crane.

325
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:38,920
好好拍打  把跳蚤打出来  这可是宝贝
Give this a good beating. Shake those fleas out. That's a dear.

326
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,140
那些观众都是白痴
That crowd was shit.

327
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,780
丫头
Girl.

328
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,260
你在后台做什么
What are you doing back here?

329
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,770
没做什么
Nothing.

330
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:54,900
那天我在观众里见过你
I saw you the other day in the audience.

331
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,570
这出愚蠢的戏你看过几次了
How many times have you seen this stupid play?

332
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,160
三次
Three times.

333
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,430
你付过钱吗
Did you pay?

334
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,820
没有
No.

335
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,990
我记得那时候戏班子来我的村子演出
I remember when the players came to my village.

336
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,140
我身上一分钱都没有  就偷偷溜进去了
I didn't have any money, so I snuck in.

337
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,750
跟你现在一样
Just like you.

338
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,950
看着上了妆的脸蛋  戏服
Saw the painted faces, the costumes,

339
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,670
听着他们唱歌
listened to the songs,

340
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,140
在年轻的恋人死在对方怀里时放声大哭
cried when the young lovers died in each other's arms.

341
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,780
第二天我就逃离村子加入了他们
I ran off and joined them the next day,

342
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,980
再也没回头
never looked back.

343
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,880
你演得真好
You're very good.

344
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,250
我最后的几句台词糟透了
My final speech is shit.

345
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,970
但是公平地说  我总喜欢这么告诉自己
But to be fair to myself, which I always like to be,

346
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,560
是剧本写得不怎么样
the writing's no good.

347
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,980
那就改写
So change it.

348
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,320
这出戏如果没有你
It would all just be farting, belching,

349
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,940
就只剩下放屁打嗝扇耳光了
and slapping without you.

350
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:47,130
你会怎样改写剧本
How would you change it?

351
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,820
王后爱他的儿子  胜过世上的一切
The queen loves her son more than anything.

352
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,380
但她连道别的机会都没有  他就死掉了
And he was taken from her before she could say good-bye.

353
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,340
她不应该只是哭
She wouldn't just cry.

354
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,830
她应该愤怒
She would be angry.

355
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,610
她渴望杀死那个令她伤心的人
She would want to kill the person who did this to her.

356
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,260
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

357
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,250
茉慈
Mercy.

358
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:23,060
你的眼睛会说话  茉慈
You have very expressive eyes, Mercy.

359
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,610
眉毛也漂亮
Wonderful eyebrows.

360
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,350
你喜欢扮演角色吗
Do you like pretending to be other people?

361
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,900
我得走了  我父亲在等着我呢
I have to go. My father's waiting for me.

362
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,560
克连恩夫人  观众们爱死你了
Lady Crane, they loved you.

363
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,720
他们太热情了  或者醉得厉害
They were sweet. Or drunk.

364
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,010
热情到醉
Drunkenly sweet.

365
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,950
奈德死的那一幕没人笑
No laugh for Ned's death.

366
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:54,360
这群观众猪狗不如
These people are worse than animals.

367
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,500
但是他们爱她  他们都爱她
But they loved her. They all love her.

368
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:02,160
没错  崇拜你的是猪狗不如的观众
Yes, you are adored by people and animals alike.

369
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,220
我尽量在这种基础上发挥
I do what I can with what I'm given.

370
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,620
哪种基础
With what you're given?

371
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,760
我只是在思考...
Well, I was thinking--

372
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,700
我们现在都是思考者了吗
Oh, we're all thinkers now, are we?

373
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,170
大奶子里全是想法
Full to the tits with ideas.

374
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,750
-我不是说...  -你有想法  我有想法
- I didn't mean-- - You have ideas, I have ideas,

375
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,470
他也有想法
he has ideas.

376
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:21,520
我的想法为什么比你们的更有价值
Why should my ideas have any more value than yours

377
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,030
就是因为我这辈子都在干这一行吗
simply because I've been doing this my whole life?

378
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,110
谁有资格来评判我的作品
Who is anyone to judge my work?

379
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:29,410
这是我的专业  我知道自己在做什么
This is my profession. I know what I'm doing.

380
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,390
你没有权利发表意见
You have no right to an opinion.

381
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,030
小心那个人
Careful of that one.

382
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,390
她想要你死
She wants you dead.

383
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,220
怎么样
And?

384
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,170
跟我预想的一样
As I expected.

385
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:39,620
真遗憾
A shame.

386
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,150
女孩天份不错
A girl had many gifts.

387
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:47,030
你答应过我
You promised me.

388
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,830
别让她受罪
Don't let her suffer.

389
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,750
全体停止前进
Company, halt!

390
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,460

提利尔大人
My lord.

392
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:59,900
朋友们  这个时刻到了
My friends, the hour has come.

393
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:03,760
疯狂已经控制了这座城市
Madness has overtaken this city

394
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:08,320
我的孩子们身陷魔爪
and grasped in its claws my children.

395
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,790
但是现在  我们必须将其
But now we must drive it back

396
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,830
打回石头缝里的老家
under the rocks whence it came.

397

疯狂的末日已至

398
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,230

00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,810
不管富人还是穷人  贵族还是平民

400
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,500
如果我们有罪  就必须赎罪
if we sin, we must atone.

401
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:39,800
提利尔家族的玛格丽
Margaery of House Tyrell

402
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,300
以罪人的身份面对我们
came to us a sinner.

403
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,570
她站在大教堂里
She stood before the gods

404
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:47,140
在诸神面前撒谎
in the holy sept and lied.

405
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,250
她对自己哥哥的罪行视而不见
She turned a blind eye to her brother's sins.

406
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,540
她羞辱了自己的家族

407
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:56,630
羞辱了她的国王  和她自己

408
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:30,270
全体停止前进

抱歉打扰了

We're here for Queen Margaery and Ser Loras Tyrell.

415
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,840
把他们交出来我们就离开
Give them to us and we'll be on our way.

416
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,050
我无权把他们交给你
I don't have the authority to give them to you.

417
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,320
你也无权带走他们
And you don't have the authority to take them.

418
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:58,080
说得对
That's right.

419
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,080
驾
Hyah.

420
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:08,920
上矛
Lock spears!

421
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,580
我代表拜拉席恩家族的国王托曼一世
I speak for King Tommen of House Baratheon, First of His Name.

422
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:18,020
诸神在此事上不认可他的权威
The gods don't recognize his authority in this matter.

423
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,670
你已经侮辱了一个大家族
You've already insulted one great house.

424
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:22,690
不会再有第二次
It won't happen twice.

425
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:24,800
在玛格丽·提利尔上街之前
Every last sparrow will die

426
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,620
我们会杀死所有的麻雀
before Margaery Tyrell walks down that street.

427
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,910
为侍奉诸神而死
To die in the service of the gods

428
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,240
我们死得其所
would please each and every one of us.

429
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,080
我们求之不得
We yearn for it.

430
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:46,050
但今天不是时候
But there is no call for it today.

431
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,100
不会有赎罪之旅
There will be no walk of atonement.

432
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,530
收阵
Order up.

433
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:13,850
玛格丽王后已经通过将另一人
Queen Margaery has already atoned for her sins

434
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,290
引入七神的圣光之下
by bringing another

435
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:19,120
赎清了她的罪孽
into the true light of the Seven.

436
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:51,440
我们在此共同宣布
Together we announce

437
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,590
和谐的新时代开启
a new age of harmony.

438
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,140
王权与信仰
A holy alliance

439
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:00,910
神圣的联合
between the Crown and the Faith.

440
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:20,490
托曼国王万岁  诸神保佑您  玛格丽王后
Long live King Tommen and bless you, Queen Margaery!

441
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,010
王权与信仰
The Crown and the Faith

442
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:26,660
是这个世界赖以依存的两大支柱
are the twin pillars upon which the world rests.

443
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:32,020
我们将携手重筑七国的荣耀
Together we will restore the Seven Kingdoms to glory.

444
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,470
怎么回事
What's happening?

445
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,510
他打败了我们
He's beaten us.

446
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,320
就是这么回事
That's what's happening.

447
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:14,980
攻击信仰  就是攻击王权
When you attack the Faith, you attack the Crown.

448
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,690
任何攻击王权的人都不应当
Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit

449
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,180
担任御林铁卫队长
to serve as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.

450
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:24,160
在你出生以前我就是御林铁卫的一员了
I've been a member of the Kingsguard since before you were born.

451
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:29,140
你不必这样做  你什么都不需要做
You don't have to do this. You don't have to do anything.

452
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,690
我必须听从诸神的指示
I have to answer to the gods.

453
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,080
在你还坐在王座上的时候就不需要
Not when you're sitting in that chair.

454
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,780
身为国王  我意已决
The Crown's decision on this matter is final.

455
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:47,210
我要裸体游街吗
Will I be walking naked in the streets?

456
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:50,340
还是先在圣堂地牢里待几个月
Or will I spend a few months in the Sept dungeons first

457
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,590
学学诸神是如何仁慈
to teach me about the gods' mercy?

458
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,530
你为你的家族
You have served your house

459
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:00,660
和国王效忠了多年
and your king faithfully for many years.

460
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:02,920
你也将继续如此
And you will continue to do so.

461
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,840
但不是在这个城市
But not in this city.

462
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:13,430
你搞丢了
You've lost it?

463
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:16,600
是的  父亲
Yes, Father.

464
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,560
那是城堡  又不是羊
It's a castle, not a bloody sheep.

465
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:22,390
你应该还知道它在哪儿
Presumably you still know where it is.

466
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,060
你没有搞丢奔流城
You didn't lose Riverrun.

467
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,350
你是让黑鱼夺走了它
You let the Blackfish take it from you.

468
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:30,280
他突袭了我们  他比任何人都更了解奔流城
He surprised us. He knows the castle better than anyone.

469
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:33,780
红色婚礼之后你倒是搞丢了黑鱼
You did lose the Blackfish after the Red Wedding.

470
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,880
他就在这个厅里  你却让他离开了
You had him right here in this hall and you let him leave.

471
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,060
然后当我要你去追捕并杀了他时
Then when I told you to hunt him down and kill him,

472
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,340
你找不到他了
you couldn't find him.

473
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,130
这才叫搞丢了
That's what it means to lose something.

474
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,840
现在他回来夺走了奔流城
Now he's come back and taken Riverrun.

475
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,840
我觉得不该怪我们...
I don't think it's fair to blame us--

476
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:52,050
我们匍匐在徒利家脚下长达三百年
For 300 years we kissed Tully boots,

477
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:55,990
向他们及其腥臭的鳟鱼旗宣誓效忠
swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners.

478
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:58,420
再也不会了  奔流城是我们的
Not again. Riverrun is ours.

479
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,920
夺回来
Take it back.

480
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:02,160
我们没有人手
We don't have the men.

481
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,800
我们的人手十倍于该死的黑鱼
We've got 10 times as many men as the damn Blackfish.

482
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:09,230
梅利斯特家已与我们为敌  还有布莱伍德家
The Mallisters have risen against us. And the Blackwoods.

483
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:12,280
无旗兄弟会正在召集平民对付我们
The Brotherhood Without banners is rallying the commoners against us,

484
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,340
抢劫我们的供给车队和军营
raiding our supply trains and camps.

485
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:17,320
奔流城能在围城战中抵抗一年
Riverrun can withstand a siege for a year.

486
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:21,060
我如果找借口  就会让她管事
If I want excuses, I'll put her in charge.

487
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,800
他们在嘲笑我们
They're laughing at us.

488
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,870
从河间地
All across the Riverlands

489
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,570
到君临城
right down to King's Landing,

490
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:28,560
他们在嘲笑我们
they're laughing at us.

491
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,870
我睡觉也能听见
I hear it in my sleep!

492
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,640
不幸的是  我还没死
I'm not dead yet, unfortunately for you.

493
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,170
并且在他们笑得哽住之前
And I'll not leave this world

494
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:38,980
我不会离开这个世界
until they all choke on that laughter.

495
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:41,190
夺回城堡
Take that castle back.

496
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:45,120
他不会屈服的  父亲
He'll never yield, Father.

497
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,930
他会的
Oh, he'll yield.

498
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,680
你  给他看你捅进婊子的肚子
You'll show him the knife

499
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,030
杀了罗柏·史塔克孩子的那把刀
you used to kill Robb Stark's child in his whore mother's belly,

500
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,030
而你  给他看你割开
and you'll show him the knife

501
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:03,660
他侄女喉咙的那把刀
you used to open his niece's throat.

502
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,240
你们要提醒他
And you'll remind him

503
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:09,370
一开始在红色婚礼上结婚的是谁
who it was that got married at the Red Wedding in the first place.

504
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,300
他的侄子
His nephew.

505
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:29,070
高兴点  艾德慕大人
Cheer up, Lord Edmure.

506
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:31,350
你要回家了
You're going home.

507
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:35,100
我被派去对付黑鱼
I'm being sent to deal with the Blackfish.

508
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,100
显然瓦德·佛雷自己处理不了
Apparently Walder Frey can't manage it on his own

509
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,200
因为他已经四百岁了
because he's 400 years old.

510
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,610
让我带兵前往奔流城
Sent me with an army to the Riverlands

511
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:44,590
打一场能持续数月的围城战
and a siege that could last months.

512
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:47,260
无论你带兵去哪儿
Better you're elsewhere at the head of an army

513
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,020
都好过被关在圣堂的地牢
than in the sept dungeons.

514
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,870
我不去河间地
I'm not going to the Riverlands.

515
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,030
那怎么办
What, then?

516
00:41:56,670 --> 00:42:00,250
我要给波隆金子  数不胜数的金子
I'm going to give Bronn the largest bag of gold anyone's ever seen

517
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,070
让他去召集最好的杀手
and have him gather the best killers he knows.

518
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,890
我带他们去大圣堂
I'll take them to the sept

519
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:06,720
我要摘下大麻雀的脑袋
and I'll remove the High Sparrow's head

520
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,890
还有我能找到的每一只麻雀的脑袋
and every other sparrow head I can find.

521
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,640
不行
You can't.

522
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:12,010
我们儿子在他手里  他抢了我们的儿子
He has our son! He stole our son!

523
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,440
他拆散了我们家
He's torn our family apart.

524
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,150
我们应该怎么对待拆散我们的人
How should we treat people who tear us apart?

525
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,520
我们应该毫不留情  我们也绝不会仁慈
We should treat them without mercy and we will.

526
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,970
可如果杀了大麻雀  你没法活着走出圣堂
But if you kill the High Sparrow, you won't leave the sept alive.

527
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:25,860
没了你  这一切都毫无意义
And without you, this is all for nothing.

528
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,060
统领我们的军队  那才是属于你的位置
Stand at the head of our army where you belong,

529
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,110
也是父亲对你的希望
where Father wanted you.

530
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:35,570
让我们的军队知道他们该效忠谁
Show our men where their loyalties belong.

531
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:37,580
让他们看看兰尼斯特的本事
Show them what Lannisters are,

532
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,680
我们对待敌人的手段
what we do to our enemies.

533
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,260
夺回那座愚蠢的小城堡
And take that stupid little castle back

534
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,700
因为它本就属于我们  因为你有这个能力
because it's ours and because you can.

535
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:48,900
你即将面临审判  我要留下来陪你
You'll stand trial soon. I need to be here for you.

536
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:52,040
那是比武审判
It will be a trial by combat.

537
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,950
我有魔山
I have the Mountain.

538
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,360
他们让我们更强大  我们所有人
They've made us both stronger, all of them.

539
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,990
他们不知道我们有多强
They have no idea how strong we are.

540
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,580
不知道我们准备如何对付他们
No idea what we're going to do to them.

541
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,850
我们一直在一起
We've always been together.

542
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,480
以后也会一直在一起
We'll always be together.

543
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,270
这世上只剩我们两个了
We're the only two people in the world.

544
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,150
为什么救我们
Why did you help us?

545
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:51,220
三眼乌鸦派我来的
The Three-Eyed Raven sent for me.

546
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,640
三眼乌鸦死了
The Three-Eyed Raven's dead.

547
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,720
现在他又活了
Now he lives again.

548
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:09,930
上次见你  你还是个小孩
When I last saw you, you were a boy.

549
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:12,560
无所畏惧
A fearless boy.

550
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,880
喜欢爬城墙  让他母亲担心坏了
Loved to climb the castle walls, frighten his mother.

551
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:18,650
你是谁
Who are you?

552
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:38,190
班扬叔叔
Uncle Benjen.

553
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:41,100
琼恩写来的最后一封信上说
The last letter Jon wrote me

554
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:42,840
你在长城外失踪了
said you had been lost beyond the Wall.

555
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:48,670
我带着游骑兵深入北边
I led a ranging party deep into the North

556
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:50,170
去寻找异鬼
to find white walkers.

557
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,650
他们找到了我们
They found us.

558
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:56,960
其中一个异鬼用一把冰剑刺中了我的肚子
A white walker stabbed me in the gut with a sword of ice.

559
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:00,890
留下我等死
Left me there to die.

560
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:02,320
转变
To turn.

561
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:05,160
森林之子找到了我
The Children found me.

562
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,630
驱散了异鬼对我的魔法控制
Stopped the walker's magic from taking hold.

563
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:09,520
怎么做的
How?

564
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,390
就是他们最初制造异鬼的办法
The same way they made the walkers in the first place.

565
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:13,760
你亲眼看过
You saw it yourself.

566
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:16,730
龙晶
Dragonglass.

567
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:21,180
一片龙晶刺进你的心脏
A shard of dragonglass plunged into your heart.

568
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,210
你现在是三眼乌鸦了
You are the Three-Eyed Raven now.

569
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:29,170
我没有足够的时间学习  我无法控制一切
I didn't have time to learn. I can't control anything.

570
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:33,460
你必须学会控制
You must learn to control it

571
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:35,950
趁着夜王还没有来
before the Night King comes.

572
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,310
喝
Drink.

573
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:45,430
不管怎样
One way or another,

574
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:48,050
他终会找到通向人类世界的路
he will find his way to the world of men.

575
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:50,100
等他找到
When he does,

576
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:53,010
你会在那里等他
you will be there waiting for him.

577
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:55,850
你会做好准备
And you will be ready.

578
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,050
没事吧
Everything all right?

579
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:21,900
骑回弥林需要多久
How many days' ride to Meereen?

580
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:23,710
最多一周
A week at best.

581
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:27,470
需要多少船才能载我的卡拉萨去维斯特洛
How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros?

582
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:29,970
多斯拉克人和他们的马
Dothraki and all their horses,

583
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:31,950
无垢者和次子团
the Unsullied, the Second Sons--

584
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:34,670
估计一千艘船
1,000 ships easily.

585
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:36,870
-可能还不够  -谁有这么多
- Probably more. - And who has that many?

586
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:38,020
没人有
Nobody.

587
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,250
目前没人有
Nobody yet.

588
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:43,690
这么说我们骑马回了弥林
So we ride for Meereen

589
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:45,910
之后就乘船去维斯特洛
and after that we sail for Westeros.

590
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:47,060
然后呢
And what then?

591
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,350
我要夺回属于我的一切
I take what is mine.

592
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:53,720
您生来就不是坐在王宫椅子上的人
You weren't made to sit on a chair in a palace.

593
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:55,300
那我生来是什么人
What was I made for?

594
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:59,550
您是征服者  风暴降生丹妮莉丝
You're a conqueror, Daenerys Stormborn.

595
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:09,290
等着
Wait here.

596
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:47,840
{\pos(193,245)}我随她去

{\pos(193,245)}与他并肩作战  保护他免于危难

600
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:54,490
{\pos(193,245)}但我不是卡奥

601
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,910
{\pos(193,245)}我也不选三位

602
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:01,250
{\pos(193,245)}我选你们全部

603
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,790
{\pos(193,245)}我的要求也比

604
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:09,690
{\pos(193,245)}任何卡奥对卡拉萨的要求都多

605
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:15,010
{\pos(193,245)}你们愿意骑着木马横渡黑色咸水吗

606
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:20,900

{\pos(193,245)}拆了他们的石头房子吗

608
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:28,830
{\pos(193,245)}你们愿为我打下七大王国吗

609
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:32,680
{\pos(193,245)}这是卓戈卡奥曾许诺我的礼物

610
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,890
{\pos(193,245)}他在圣母山前向我发誓

611
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:40,160
{\pos(193,245)}你们愿跟随我吗

612
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,320
{\pos(193,245)}从现在起
